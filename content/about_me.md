I'm a Master of Computer Science student at Rice University, where I'm currently focusing on constraint motion planning and task planning. My academic journey began at Lehigh University, where I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Computer Science. My passion lies at the intersection of these fields, where I explore innovative solutions to complex computational problems.
